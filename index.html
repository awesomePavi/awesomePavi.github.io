                <p>
                    This picture frame project began with a $10 monitor that I picked up at a garage sale (for no real reason). Later on I was at my grandparents home and was constantly asked how to look through the gallery on the phone and how to make the picture bigger, since they want to see what their grandchildren and great-grandchildren are up to around the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I looked into digital pictures frames so that they could see what everyone is up to, but existings ones are small and required someone to physically update the photos. This is when everything clicked and I decided to build a picture frame, that would be larger then the average digital picture frame while allowing for auto updates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The picture frame has 3 main components:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; - The picture frame itself
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; - The software running on the picture frame to pull updated photos
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; - The web-server and interface to allow the grandchildren around the world to add photos
                </p>

                <p>

                    <br>
                    - Raspberry PI Zero, as it is low cost, has a base linux operating system to build on and allows for wifi connection
                    <br>
                    - Using Amazon web Services to host, and use as a data storage system
                    <br>
                    - Website to allow people on all platforms, desktop and mobile to easily upload photos

                <p>
                    The majority of images taken are in portrait mode which does not look good when it consumes the entire landscape picture frame. So I am looking into a collage based uplaod process, where people can upload multiple photos select a background and choose how their images are displayed.

                    I've moved a lot and made many friends over the past 20 years, and depending on where I am I'll reach out to people in that area. A small annoyance I always found was that when I switch phones, or even with time the photos, address, names and in general social media information that I keep saved for my contacts become outdated. This app will help alleviate this problem, especially when it comes to getting a new phone, where the only information I have is the name and phone number of individuals.

            <h2 class="split">Why Project Oriented</h2>
            <p>
              Having not updated my websit since 2017, it looked good but I found that it was quite a hassel to keep 3 resumes up to date, that being my linkeding profile, actual resume and website. Something else I began to realize is that when friends and other developers go to my website it's to see my projects, and potential employers will supplment my resume with my website so their is no real reason to have two copies of my resume both physical and online.
              <br>
              <br>
              Thus this time I focused on a complete projct based approach, as the total number of projects I work on go up it becomes harder to show it all in detail on one page, so I shifted to using small cards that expand to reveal details.

                <p>
                  Over the past century, programming has become a very powerful tool utilized in endless applications. Alan Turing’s Enigma machine was pivotal in changing the tides of war. The introduction of the world wide web, and with it Amazon, Google, and various infamous sites have changed the way the world accesses information. It is evident programming, in more ways than one, has changed the way the world operates, but it has also changed the lives of the less fortunate for the better. Domain-specific programming and embedded computation have the ability to give disease diagnosed individuals a chance at independence again.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Victims of paralyses diseases almost always result in the individual losing their ability to speak along with their diminished physical abilities, think Stephen Hawking due to his Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This is why interactive communications software must be made to help said individuals relay and convey messages locally to others. Engineers have the ability to revive lives through these simple embedded applications.

                <h2 class="split">Our Idea</h2>
                <p>
                  The overall idea to confront this challenge consisted of two main sections an Easy to Use UI with predictive text and the part that really set us apart which was a unique input system. So that the end-user would be able to use the system with varying degrees of paralysis.
                </p>
                <h2 class="split">Design and Predictive text</h2>
                <p>
                  After doing some more research into these disorders we found that there are effects on the user vision alongside the loss of fine motor skills. We wanted to account for this by using a high contrast User Interface with large buttons as well as predictive text such that the user does not have to write out each word individually.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2 class="split">Input System</h2>
                <p>
                  We wanted to be innovative in our input system since we wanted to develop something that did not rely too heavily on fine motor skills. To this end, we moved away from the traditional keyboard layout and looked into a different input system which we modelled around the old cellphone T9 (Text on 9 keys) system. Where instead of clicking on a number then clicking again to cycle through letters. We used swipes of to cycle through rows and columns and then taps to cycle through the characters at the selected row and column.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The resulting system had a bit of a learning curve to it but once a user gets the hang of it we believe that it will be faster than a traditional keyboard. And since we are not limited by 9 keys since we can use a dynamic number of rows and columns to add more characters in as needed.

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                  Our solution was developed in 3 sections UI, Predictive Text and the input system. When the competition was completed and after running into a few speed bumps along the way we were able to get a rough system working with the input system and user-interface working. While we were unable to get the Predictive text system integrated. Interface below.

            <p>
              My personal website is intended to showcase my projects and skills that I have developed over the years. I have a goal of annually updating the website for this vary reason, in 2016 I made my first personal website and it follows the tacky scheme that you would see in thea early days of websites. A lot was going on and the contrast and colours made for a bright website. On-top of this people would have to navigate to my projects and resume the parts that truly showcase my skills.
              Which is what lead to this redesign.
              <br>
              <br>
              This new website has a core focus on my resume with 3 navigation options, to guide focus to what I want people and potential employers to see:
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;- Projects page, where all my projects can be found
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;- Resume page, where an updated copy of my resume is available for download and vieing on the website
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;- A quick link to my Github, to see what I am up to.

              The site prompts for a username to be entered upon loading. The server then sends back any chat logs so the new user can view the history of the chat. Each user is given a unique colour in the chat window. The chat currently only supports text-based chat, but on mobile you are able to include emoticons. The message field is located at the top of the page, to deal with issues with software keyboards on mobile

              <hr>
              Ensuring Usernames are uniqie, as it is right now with the barebones development, each computer has a unique ID, but usernames can overlap. Checking usernames and forcing users to have unique usernmaes would be benefical to reduce confusion.
              <hr>
              The disconnect system that is currentely implemented uses the sockets onDisconnect call which is called at the end of a `keep-alive` cycle. This means a user appears logged in for a few minutes after the log out. Something attached to the window on close command in Javascript that can send a message to the server would be more effective.
              <hr>
              Move the message input field to the bottom of the page like traditional messaging applications. The front-end of this application was assembeled very quikly with usability in mind, the message input field was placed at the top so mobile phones and tables would not have the on-screen keyboard cover the input field. This can be resolved on the front-end side.

            <h2 class="split">Market Gap</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of this website is simple to aid in the conversion of AppleMusic and Spotify playlists across platforms.The reason for the development of this website occurred in two steps. First I was a long time Spotify user who switched to apple music, so I made a system to convert Spotify Playlists to Apple Music, a little while later I switched back to Spotify and then needed to convert an Apple Music Playlist to a Spotify Playlist. I was unable to find any free service which did not require an IOS device or were free (which did not use security vulnerabilities which were patched as of iTunes version 12.5.4). to this end, I decided it would be in my best interest to create my own system to do this.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h2 class="split">Apple Music To Spotify</h2>
              <p>
                The system required a public share link for an iTunes playlist to be provided. Using the apple music toolbox the playlist can be converted to a nice widget. From this point the system converted the playlist in 5 steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>Use the Spotify API to gain access to Create and Search API</li>
                  <li>Parse the Apple Music Widget, to get Song Titles and Artists</li>
                  <li>Check if a Spotify playlist has the same name if so prompt the user</li>
                  <li>Use the Spotify search API to find the songs then add them to the created palylist</li>
                  <li>Display the new playlist as a widget and let the user know what songs could not be added automatically</li>
                </ul>
                The biggest issue that I am currently having with this implementation is the search accuracy, for a portion of the songs, are being picked up as an Acapella cover, or another variant of the original song.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h2 class="split">Spotify To Apple Music</h2>
              <p>
                The idea I had was simple, to re-create the iTunes playlist structure I did this by making a simple apple music playlist and exporting it from iTunes. I reverse engineered the playlist style and discovered what information I would need to successfully mimic a playlist. I went about building this playlist builder in 4 steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>Use the Spotify API to gain access to Spotify playlist and track info</li>
                  <li>Build a user interface to select a playlist to convert</li>
                  <li>Create a downloadable text file to import into iTunes, through HTML and JavaScript</li>
                  <li>Use the iTunes search API, and search songs with the track name and artist provided by Spotify. Assuming the first result returned was correct</li>
                </ul>
                The biggest issue I ran into occurred at the 4th step, for Apple Music requires composer information in the playlist file in-order to successfully include the track. This is a piece of Data that I was unable to get from the iTunes API. I then explored different options trying to play with AppleScripts and Apple Music API to make a desktop based system but the API for Apple Music in its current capacity is for IOS.

            <h2 class="split">Status</h2>
            <p>
              Due to these setbacks the website currently creates Spotify widgets with its Apple Music counterpart, allowing users to find their tracks in Apple Music but until further notice, the automated transfer of a playlist is unlikely to occur.
